                            This bar chart illustrates the relationship between average diamond price, cut quality, and color grade. 
                            The x-axis categorizes diamonds by cut (Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, and Ideal), 
                            while the y-axis shows the average price in US dollars. Each bar within a cut category represents a different color grade, 
                            ranging from J (lowest) to D (highest). Interestingly, the chart reveals that diamonds with lower color grades, 
                            such as J and I, tend to have higher average prices across all cut categories. 
                            This may seem counterintuitive since color grades closer to D are considered higher quality. 
                            However, it suggests that diamonds with lower color grades might have higher carat weights, 
                            which significantly impact price more than color alone. Additionally, the Premium cut diamonds generally show the 
                            highest average prices, particularly for lower color grades, while Ideal cut diamonds, which are known for their 
                            excellent proportions, surprisingly have lower average prices. This may be due to the fact that Ideal cuts are more 
                            common in smaller carat diamonds, which are less expensive overall. Fair and Good cuts also display relatively high 
                            average prices for lower color grades, again likely due to the influence of size. Overall, the chart reinforces that 
                            diamond price is influenced by the interaction of multiple featuresâ€”cut, color, and most importantly, caratâ€”rather 
                            than any single attribute on its own.

                            This bar chart illustrates the relationship between average diamond price, cut quality, and clarity grade. 
                            The x-axis displays different cut categoriesâ€”Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, and Ideal
                            â€”while the y-axis shows the average price in US dollars. Each bar within a cut group represents a different clarity grade, 
                            ranging from I1 (lowest clarity) to IF (Internally Flawless, highest clarity). 
                            Interestingly, the chart reveals a somewhat counterintuitive pattern: diamonds with lower clarity grades, such as SI2, 
                            tend to have higher average prices across most cut categories. For example, SI2 diamonds show the highest average prices 
                            in the Premium and Very Good categories. On the other hand, diamonds with higher clarity grades like VVS1 and VVS2 
                            often have lower average prices. This suggests that clarity alone does not determine diamond price and that other 
                            factorsâ€”most likely carat weightâ€”may have a stronger influence. Larger diamonds with lower clarity may command higher
                            prices simply due to their size, despite not being as visually flawless. Additionally, while Premium and Very Good cuts 
                            generally have higher average prices than Fair and Good cuts, Ideal cuts do not show the highest prices, likely because 
                            they are more commonly available in smaller sizes. Overall, this chart emphasizes that the relationship between clarity 
                            and price is complex and influenced by interactions with other variables, particularly carat, making it important to 
                            analyze multiple features together when evaluating diamond value.
