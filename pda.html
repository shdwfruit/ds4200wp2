                                The scatter plot shows a strong positive relationship between carat and price, 
                                consistent with earlier findings. However, since carat is derived from the diamond's volume, 
                                it's closely tied to the dimensions x, y, and z. This implies that as x, y, and z increase, 
                                carat and therefore price also tend to increase. We see that diamonds with larger dimensions 
                                often fall into higher price ranges, but the relationship becomes more dispersed at 
                                higher prices, suggesting that other factors (like cut and clarity) also contribute to the 
                                final value.

                                        <Strong>x-Dimension (Length) Patterns: </Strong>Across all price ranges, the x dimension is typically 
                                        between 4 mm and 8 mm, peaking around 5-6.5 mm. Lower-priced diamonds (under 4,000) 
                                        tend to have smaller x-values, often below 6 mm, while higher-priced diamonds frequently 
                                        exceed 6 mm in length. As price increases, the frequency of x-values also shifts 
                                        to the right, with higher-priced diamonds having larger lengths. In the highest price 
                                        range (above $16,000), x-dimensions are frequently above 8 mm, indicating that longer 
                                        diamonds contribute to premium pricing.

                                        <Strong>y-Dimension (Width) Patterns: </Strong>The y dimension follows a similar distribution to x. 
                                        For most diamonds, y ranges from 4 mm to 8 mm, with a concentration between 
                                        5.5 and 7.5 mm. In lower price ranges, y dimensions are more concentrated at the 
                                        lower end (around 5-6 mm), while in higher price brackets, y spreads out towards 
                                        8 mm and beyond. In the highest price segment, y-dimension values approach or exceed 
                                        9 mm, reinforcing the pattern that physically larger diamonds fetch higher prices.

                                        <Strong>z-Dimension (Depth) Patterns: </Strong>The z dimension also reflects a consistent trend: 
                                        as price increases, so does z. For most diamonds, z ranges from 2 mm to 5.5 mm, 
                                        with peaks around 3.5-4.5 mm. High-priced diamonds typically have a z-dimension closer 
                                        to 5 mm or above, suggesting greater depth. However, z shows a slightly narrower 
                                        spread than x and y, likely due to tighter tolerances in cut quality and proportions 
                                        required for optimal brilliance.

                                <p>
                                    The physical dimensions x, y, and z are highly correlated with carat and therefore with price. 
                                    As these dimensions increase, so does the price of the diamond. Among them, the 
                                    x and y dimensions (length and width) show the most noticeable spread across 
                                    price categories, making them good indicators of size and price potential. 
                                    While z (depth) also increases with price, its tighter distribution reflects stricter 
                                    design constraints. Overall, the relationship between diamond price and size is both 
                                    strong and nonlinear, and x, y, z offer useful predictive insights when assessing 
                                    diamond value.
