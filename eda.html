                            This provides an overview of how frequently different categories appear in the dataset, 
                            we created an interactive bar chart that allows users to switch between cut, color, and clarity 
                            distributions using a dropdown menu. This tool enables flexible exploration of the diamond dataset 
                            and enhances understanding of how the diamonds are categorized.

                            </br>
                            </br>

                            <Strong>Cut Distribution: </Strong>Among all cut grades, Ideal dominates the dataset, accounting for the highest 
                            number of diamonds, followed by Premium and Very Good. Good and Fair cuts appear much 
                            less frequently. This skewed distribution suggests that most diamonds in the dataset are cut to 
                            higher standards, aligning with market demand for well-cut stones that enhance brilliance.

                            </br>
                            </br>

                            <Strong>Color Distribution: </Strong>Color grade G has the highest count, followed closely by E, F, and H. 
                            The frequency decreases for lower color grades, with I and J being the least represented. 
                            This pattern indicates that near-colorless diamonds are more common, possibly reflecting both 
                            customer preferences and market availability.

                            </br>

                            <Strong>Clarity Distribution: </Strong>The clarity grade SI1 occurs most frequently, followed by VS2, SI2, and VS1. 
                            High-clarity diamonds such as IF and VVS1 are relatively rare in the dataset. This suggests that 
                            diamonds with minor inclusions are more prevalent and likely preferred for their balance of 
                            appearance and affordability.

                            This interactive histogram visualization presents the frequency distribution of three key 
                            numerical attributes in the diamond dataset: carat, depth, and table. Users can switch between 
                            variables using a dropdown menu to better explore individual patterns in the data.

                            </br>
                            </br>

                            <Strong>Carat Distribution: </Strong>The carat variable, representing diamond weight, displays a right-skewed 
                            distribution. Most diamonds fall within the range of 0.2 to 1 carat, with a sharp decline in 
                            frequency as carat size increases. This suggests that smaller diamonds are more commonly available, 
                            while larger diamonds are rarer and likely more expensive, though price is not depicted here.

                            <Strong>Depth Distribution: </Strong>The depth percentage (the ratio of height to average diameter) shows a more 
                            symmetrical distribution centered around 61%, which aligns with standard proportions for round 
                            brilliant cuts. The majority of diamonds fall between 59% and 63%, indicating consistent cutting 
                            practices within this range.

                            </br>
                            </br>
                            
                            <Strong>Table Distribution: </Strong>The table percentage (the width of the top facet relative to the diamond's 
                            diameter) also exhibits a concentrated distribution, with most values clustered between 54% and 60%. 
                            This reflects preferred cutting standards, as table size plays a crucial role in how light enters 
                            and reflects within the diamond.

                        <p>

                            To complement our numerical and scatter plot analyses, we created a Sankey diagram to visualize 
                            the flow relationships among three key categorical attributes of diamonds: cut, clarity, and color. 
                            This visual approach helps reveal how different combinations of these features are distributed 
                            within the dataset. Each node in the diagram represents a category within one attribute, 
                            and each link illustrates the volume of diamonds transitioning from one category to another. 
                            The thicker the link, the more diamonds follow that path.

                            </br>
                            </br>

                            This visualization provides intuitive insight into which combinations are most common, 
                            such as the strong prevalence of Ideal cut diamonds paired with SI1 or VS2 clarity, and 
                            mid-range color grades like G and H. It also highlights how certain clarity levels (e.g., SI2, VS2) 
                            serve as a bridge across multiple cuts and colors, reflecting market preferences for 
                            balancing quality and price.

                        <p>
                            The correlation matrix heatmap provides insight into the relationships between the numerical features in the diamonds dataset. 
                            One of the most prominent patterns is the strong positive correlation between carat and price (0.92), 
                            indicating that as the weight of a diamond increases, its price tends to rise significantly. Additionally, 
                            the physical dimensions of the diamond‚Äîrepresented by x (length), y (width), and z (depth in mm)‚Äîare also strongly correlated 
                            with both carat and price, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.86 to 0.98. These variables tend to increase together, 
                            suggesting that larger diamonds in physical size are not only heavier but also more expensive. 
                            However, since x, y, and z are highly correlated with each other, including all of them in further analysis may introduce multicollinearity. 
                            It would be more efficient to select just one of these, or rely on carat alone as it already encapsulates size.
                            <br/>
                            <br/>
                            On the other hand, depth and table show weak correlations with price and other variables. Depth, in particular, has near-zero correlation 
                            with price (-0.011) and negligible relationships with other features, making it a poor predictor. Table has a slightly higher correlation 
                            with price (0.13), but still too weak to be considered influential. Interestingly, there is a modest negative correlation between depth and 
                            table (-0.3), which might reflect a trade-off in diamond geometry. Based on these observations, the most valuable variables for further 
                            analysis are carat, and the physical dimensions (x, y, and z) are better to discuss together, and categorical features such as 
                            cut, color, and clarity, which are not included in the heatmap but are likely important for predicting price. 
                            Depth and table may be excluded from further analysis due to their weak associations.
