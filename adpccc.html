                            <Strong>General Pattern: All Cuts Combined</Strong>
                            <br/>
                            In the first scatter plot that includes all cuts, we observe a clear positive correlation between carat and price: 
                            as the carat of a diamond increases, its price tends to rise. However, this relationship is nonlinear‚Äîprices 
                            grow faster at higher carats, suggesting that price increases exponentially with carat size. 
                            There's a dense concentration of diamonds under 2 carats and $6,000, indicating these are the most common 
                            and accessible options. Above 2 carats, diamonds become much rarer and significantly more expensive. 
                            Additionally, we see overlapping dots from different cuts, indicating that cut alone doesn't solely determine 
                            price‚Äîother factors like color and clarity may play a role.
                            <br/>

                            <Strong>Individual Cut Trends</Strong>
                            <br/>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <Strong>Fair Cut</Strong>: Diamonds with a Fair cut tend to have greater variation in price 
                                    for the same carat weight. Some Fair cut diamonds with high carat values exceed $15,000, while others 
                                    of similar weight are significantly less expensive. This suggests inconsistency, potentially due to lower 
                                    perceived quality or trade-offs in other attributes like clarity or color.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <Strong>Good Cut</Strong>: Good cut diamonds display a moderate upward trend. Most diamonds in this category 
                                    fall below 2 carats and $10,000. There is more price consistency than Fair cut diamonds, 
                                    suggesting slightly better overall quality, but still notable variability.
                                </li>

                                    <Strong>Very Good Cut</Strong>: Diamonds with a Very Good cut show a tighter and more consistent 
                                    relationship between carat and price. Prices rise steadily with carat weight, 
                                    and the spread is narrower compared to Fair and Good cuts. Most diamonds are under 2.5 carats and $12,000, 
                                    indicating popularity among buyers seeking balance between quality and price.

                                <li>
                                    <Strong>Ideal Cut</Strong>: Ideal cut diamonds are concentrated in the lower carat range (below 2 carats) 
                                    with prices mostly under $10,000. This could reflect market preference for Ideal cuts in smaller, 
                                    well-proportioned stones. The price-to-carat trend is consistent, though not as steep as Premium cuts. 
                                    These diamonds tend to offer high quality at more modest sizes.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <Strong>Premium Cut</Strong>: Premium cut diamonds demonstrate one of the clearest and strongest upward trends. 
                                    There are many high-carat diamonds in this group, with prices stretching well past $15,000. 
                                    This indicates that Premium cuts are often chosen for larger, more luxurious diamonds and that the 
                                    market places higher value on this combination.
                                </li>

                            <Strong>Summary of Price, Carat, and Cut Relationship</Strong>:
                            <br/>
                            Across all individual charts, the strongest factor influencing price is carat, with price rising as carat increases, 
                            especially beyond the 2-carat mark. However, cut also plays a role: Premium and Very Good cuts tend to have higher price ranges 
                            at similar carats, while Ideal cuts are more concentrated in smaller diamonds. Fair cuts show the most price variability, 
                            possibly reflecting inconsistencies in quality or market value. These scatter plots confirm the finding from the 
                            correlation matrix that carat is the most powerful predictor of diamond price, but also suggest that cut quality interacts 
                            with carat to shape the final price.

                        <p>
                            The scatter plots show that diamond color significantly influences price patterns, 
                            especially when controlling for carat size. Higher color grades like D, E, and F‚Äîconsidered 
                            more colorless and desirable‚Äîtend to have tighter, more consistent price distributions, 
                            with prices generally higher across similar carat weights. As the color grade declines from G to J, 
                            the price variation increases, and diamonds of the same carat often sell for less. 
                            Lower color grades are more sensitive to other factors like cut and clarity, resulting in a 
                            wider spread of prices. Overall, better color grades not only command higher prices but also 
                            show greater pricing consistency, while lower grades are more variable and influenced by 
                            other diamond qualities.

                            The scatter plots show that clarity has a significant impact on diamond pricing, 
                            especially when comparing diamonds of similar carat weight. As clarity improves‚Äîfrom lower grades 
                            like I1 and SI2 to higher grades such as VS2, VVS2, and IF‚Äîthe overall price trend shifts upward, 
                            indicating that higher clarity diamonds are valued more even at the same carat. 
                            In lower clarity plots (e.g., I1, SI2), prices are more scattered and tend to fall below the 
                            regression line, reflecting lower market value and greater variability. In contrast, 
                            higher clarity grades show tighter clustering and more data points above the regression line, 
                            suggesting these diamonds consistently command premium prices. This pattern highlights how clarity 
                            not only enhances a diamond's quality but also significantly elevates its market price, 
                            particularly in higher carat ranges where quality differences are more noticeable and impactful.
