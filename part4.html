                <Strong>Summary of Price, Carat, and Cut Relationship</Strong>:
                <br/>
                The analyses reveal that diamond price is predominantly driven by carat and physical dimensions, 
                with carat emerging as the strongest predictorâ€”especially as diamonds exceed the 2-carat mark. 
                The x and y dimensions, representing length and width, contribute notably to price variability, 
                while the z dimension (depth) follows a tighter distribution due to design constraints. 
                Additionally, the quality of the cut interacts with carat to influence price, as Premium and Very Good cuts typically command 
                higher price ranges, whereas Ideal cuts tend to be found in smaller diamonds and Fair cuts display greater variability. 
                Together, these findings underscore that while cut and clarity play significant roles, the overall size, 
                expressed both in carat and in physical dimensions, remains the most powerful determinant of a diamond's market value.
